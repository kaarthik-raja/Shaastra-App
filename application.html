<b>Why? </b>I want to take the ‘road not taken’ to start.I really enjoyed the process of filling this Application, and hope the same with being a Shaastra Coord.
<b>How? </b>
I want to do this to the fullest of my ability.I think i’m ready to explore new stuff and implement them in the website.I collabrate with people well (My App got a good input amount  from Rohit).
<b>What? </b>
I would make the Backend Structure for Shaastra App that will be deployed for public.</div>

What do you think are the drawbacks of Shaastra 2016 site? It
can be related to anything, for example, it may be related to UI/UX (or)
performance (or) page design etc.,       </a>

I liked the Homepage so much but then the Events Details Page didnt have much Style in it .It looked as if made only using html without Bootstrap or CSS. </div>

How do you think you can improve the current Shaastra
website? You can list whatever feature you have felt missing and youfeel it would be good if included in the site.     </a>

    <div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">
I think Some Carousel would brighten things up.<br>The  Userpage could also be improved , the display of registered events details (if i remember rightly) was not good looking,which can be improved.<br>Animation amount can be increased (Like Picture Zoom up,New Page Sliding in, Fade etc).      </div>

What do you think is the role of a Backend department in the
Webops (Technically), where do you think the backend department
will face problems and also explain the result of those effects on the
Website, So list a few Problems and comment on them.        </a>

My role as a Backend Coordinator(!) would be to maintain databases,create structures , models to link and maintain  the data and its integrity.To make Secure pathway(api calls) for database so that improper requests cannot be done to Server leading to Data Theft or Corruption. Deploy the front end (Website) pages in our server .<br><b>Problems:</b><br>
A Fire Like in IC&RC might destroy the data of participants.(Secure a remote Backup From time to time)<br>
Server can crash due to overload .(Make our website to rely less on requests eg if we tested and showed that the put is working properly,we need not get the response, just modify the local data in browser and display it without sending a res body from server).<br>
Assuming the servers are student’s computers(?) . We need to be prepared if the present computer errs up.Be well practised to set new server immediately.    </div>
